            <p>Olive oil is rich in good monounsaturated fat, making it an ideal food for heart health. In fact, studies show that replacing two tablespoons of saturated fat (found in butter and lard) with monounsaturated fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. But that‚Äôs not the only reason to eat it. A study in the journal Nature reports that olive oil also has potent anti-inflammatory properties, meaning it can help reduce pain and swelling just like a dose of ibuprofen. In addition to cooking with olive oil and using it as a dressing for your salad, you can get even more in your diet by mixing a tablespoon or two into your daily protein shak</p>

            <p>Tiny as they are, beans can help you feel energized and fuller longer than<br> almost anything else you can eat. The reason is twofold: They‚Äôre incredibly high in fiber, which swells in your stomach and promotes a feeling of fullness. And, they‚Äôre stuffed with a highly complex form of carbohydrate that can take your body a long while to convert into energy.<br> Like meat, they‚Äôre also packed with protein. But unlike meat, they‚Äôve got no saturated fats. ‚ÄúBeans of all types are always high on most nutritionists‚Äô lists,‚Äù<br> says Chicago-based nutritionist Jennifer R. Bathgate, R.D. So why‚Äôd our experts pick the black variety? Easy. Ounce for ounce, they have more fiber per<br> serving than any other member of the legume family.</p>

            <p>‚ÄúAn egg a day is A-OK,‚Äù says Ward. Here‚Äôs why: Eggs contain a heavy-hitting 4 grams of pure muscle-building amino acids inside every shell, in addition to boasting some of the highest naturally available doses around of a vitamin called choline, which is thought to help enhance memory. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the gold standard in terms of providing all the right nutrients for muscle growth,‚Äù says Ward.</p>
